Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/). As a full-time house and pet sitter I am constantly moving between work from home settings, forcing me to travel lightly. I borrow home office furniture, such as desks and external monitors when it's available.

## Hardware

* **Computer:** Apple MacBook Pro M1 8-Core 13-Inch (2020)
Starting to show signs of age, especially when running ArcGIS Pro on Parallels.
* **Headphones:** Apple EarPods (USB-C)
Because wired is better. No latency, no need to charge, no slippery AirPods.
* **Mouse:** Logitech MX Vertical
My first mouse after using laptops track pads for years. I had started to notice signs of RSI in my wrist, but the handshake orientation of this mouse relieved symptoms.
* **Phone:** Apple iPhone 15
USB-C charging is the best. But the satisfying sound iPhone makes when connecting to MagSafe? Even better.
* **eReader:** Kobo Clara 2E
I accidentally bought the Clara HD at first, but the lack of waterproofing was a deal-breaker. I  swapped it for the 2E. The Clara is painfully slow so I'll be looking for a replacement in future.
