# About

Hi, I'm Gerhard Lanz.

Senior spatial advisor to the aspatial. Based in Aotearoa, New Zealand, I develop creative solutions to geospatial problems. Driven by a desire to improve our understanding of the world, I seek to make positive impact through location information.

I have a background in traditional graphic design. And as a result, I'm drawn to projects that need a high degree of craft, vision, and design thinking. I am passionate about minimalism and simplicity, and strive to incorporate these values into all aspects of life.

When I’m not at my keyboard, I enjoy being outdoors and offline. Please email me@gerhardla.nz.

## Colophon

I apply an “[ultralight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/) mentality” to both backpacking (known as *tramping* in Zealand) and design. This is reflected in my personal website, which also endeavors to "leave no trace."
