[Slash pages](https://slashpages.net/) organise the content of this website into different sections, each accessibile by a specific one-word URL. These pages are commonly found across the web, usually with a standard, root-level slug like `/now`, `/about`, or `/uses`. My website has a few of these – here they are:

* [/blog](/blog): lists all of my blog posts.
* [/now](/now): what I'm focused on at this point in my life.
* [/slashes](/slashes): meta – a list of all slash pages (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist).
* [/sitemap](/sitemap): an XML file with a list of URLs for pages on this website so that web crawlers can find them.

I'll try to keep these updated as the site changes.
