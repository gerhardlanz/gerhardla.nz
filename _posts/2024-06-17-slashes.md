* [Slash pages](https://slashpages.net/) organise the content of this website into different sections, each accessibile by a specific one-word URL. These pages are commonly found across the web, usually with a standard, root-level slug like `/now`, `/about`, or `/uses`. My website has a few of these – here they are:
* [/accessibility](/accessibility): accessibility statement for this website including the accessibility standard applied
* [/blog](/blog): lists all of my blog posts.
* [/colophon](/colophon): a page that describes how this website is made, with what tools, supporting what technologies.
* [/now]/(/now): what I'm focused on at this point in my life.
* [/privacy](/privacy): the privacy policy for this website and my PGP public key.
* [/slashes](/slashes): meta – a list of all slash pages (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist).
* [/sitemap](/sitemap): an XML file with a list of URLs for pages on this website so that web crawlers can find them.
* [/uses](/uses): details of the things I use on a daily basis.

I'll try to keep these updated as the site changes.
