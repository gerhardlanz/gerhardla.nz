Is a map inherently spatial?

Yes, a map is inherently spatial because it represents geographic or spatial relationships between different features, locations, or phenomena. Maps depict the arrangement and organization of these elements in a two-dimensional format, allowing users to understand distances, directions, and the relative positions of places. This spatial representation is fundamental to the purpose of maps, whether they are used for navigation, analysis, or visualization of data.
