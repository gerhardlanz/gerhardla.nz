<h1>Gerhard</h1>

<p>Senior Geospatial Advisor to the aspatial, he/him</p>

<p>Based in Aotearoa, New Zealand, I develop creative solutions to geospatial problems. Driven by a desire to improve our understanding of the world, I seek to make positive impact through location information.</p>

I have a background in traditional graphic design. And as a result, I'm drawn to projects that need a high degree of craft, vision, and design thinking. I am passionate about minimalism and simplicity, and strive to incorporate these values into all aspects of life.
